## Description

An accountability based ads + adult filter to help meet your productivity goals üí™

üò© Tired of ads and adult content? Want a no-fuss way to get rid of them completely?

üèÉ Want to hold yourself accountable to your internet history?

BrickGuard sets up a VPN tunnel with an internal dnsmasq resolver targetted at blocking adult and ad domains.

**Toggle filter level** - toggle your desired internet filter level. Behind the scenes, BrickGuard automatically routes your internet traffic to cleanbrowsing.org or OpenDNS servers that do a pre-filtering on malicious websites ‚ö°

**Block and track your internet traffic** - BrickGuard uses an internal dnsmasq resolver that captures and tracks the malicious sites you attempt to visit üëÄ

**Blacklist custom domains** - You get to choose which domains you don't want to see üôà

**Accountability partner emails** - üåüüåüüåü Here's where it gets cool! If you specify an accountability partner email, BrickGuard sends weekly reports about the malicious sites you've tried to visit, as well as any attempts to change the service configuration üíÇ


## Behind the scenes

This application creates a VPN tunnel to handle all DNS requests. An internal dnsmasq resolver parses dnsmasq configuration files to block attempts to malicious domains, and selects upstream DNS servers from cleanbrowsing.org and OpenDNS Family Shield to safely protect the user from accessing blocked domains. A worker thread sends a usage report every week to a specified accountability partner email address.
